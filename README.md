# Cartoon Classification on Android using TF Lite

To use this app, you need to have a pre-trained image classification TF Lite model. This app can be used for any custom-trained model. 

## Steps:
It is assumed that you already have a TF Lite image classification model of yourself.

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.

2. Copy your `.tflite` model and its corresponding `label.txt` file inside `Cartoon-Classification-on-Android-using-TF-Lite\app\src\main\assets` folder.

3. Open the project in Android Studio and let the project build itself.

4. Open `MainActivity.java` file and edit **Line 169** by replacing `cartoon_model.tflite` with the name of your TF Lite model. Also edit **Line 231** by replacing `cartoon_labels.txt` with the name of your model's label file.

5. Build and run the app on your physical device or on emulator.
